## Usage

To use React Toast Popup in your React application, follow these steps:

Import the useNotification hook and necessary styles in your component:

```

Initialize the useToast hook with your preferred position:

```jsx
const { ToastContainer, triggerToast } =
  useToast(positon of your choice);
```

#### Postions

- "bottom-left"
- "bottom-right"
- "top-left"
- "top-right"
- "top-center"

Use ToastContainer in your JSX to display toast:

```jsx
return (
  <div className="App">
    {ToastContainer}
    {/* Your other JSX content */}
  </div>
);
```

Trigger toast using the triggerToast function:

```jsx
triggerToast({
  type: "success",
  message: "This is a success message!",
  duration: 3000,  //Optional
  animation: "pop", //Optional
});
```

#### Animations

You can specify an animation type for the toast. The available animations are:

- "fade"
- "pop"
- "slide"

```jsx
triggerToast({
  type: "success",
  message: "This is a success message with a pop animation!",
  duration: 3000,
  animation: "pop",
});
```

## API

```jsx
useToast(position: PositionType)
```

This hook returns an object with the following properties:

- `ToastConatiner`: React element representing the notification container.
- `tiggerToast(toastProps: ToastProps)`: Function to trigger a notification with the specified properties.

The tiggerToast function accepts an object of type ToastProps, which includes:


- type: Type of the notification (success, info, warning, error).
- message: Message to display in the notification.
- duration (optional): Duration in milliseconds for which the notification should be displayed.
- animation (optional): Animation type for the notification (fade, pop, slide).
- onClose (optional): Closing Function for the toast

  const handleButtonClick = () => {
    tiggerToast({
      type: "success",
      message: "This is a success message!",
      duration: 3000,
    });
